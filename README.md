# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-project
using Convolutional network i made this project , DATASET: MNIST
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
